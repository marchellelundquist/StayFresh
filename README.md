# StayFresh
HackHarvard Project

StayFresh is a project that my team worked on during HackHarvard 2015.  Due to errors with software and compatibility, we were unable to connect our backend data to our frontend Swift code.  However, we are hoping to complete this program soon and we had a lot of fun with it!
