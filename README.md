# StayFresh
HackHarvard Project

StayFresh is a project that my team worked on during HackHarvard 2015, when I was a freshman in college.  The application aims to keep track of the items present in the user's fridge, as well as their expiration dates.  When an item is 3 days or so from expiring, the user will receive a notification that their food is about to go bad, and the app will suggest recipes for the user to use any ingredients that are about to expire.

Due to errors with software and compatibility, we were unable to connect our backend data to our frontend Swift code.  However, we had a lot of fun with this project and hope to use the skills we developed in the future!

My role in this project was user interface design and some Swift coding.  I also aided in the collection of data needed to complete the project.
