# StayFresh
HackHarvard Project

StayFresh is a project that my team worked on during HackHarvard 2015.  Due to errors with software and compatibility, we were unable to connect our backend data to our frontend Swift code.  However, we are hoping to complete this program soon and we had a lot of fun with it!

My role in this project was primarily with the UI and some Swift code.  I also aided in the collection of data needed to complete the project.

When the application is finished, its function will be to keep track of the items present in the user's fridge, as well as their expiration dates.  When an item is 3 days or so from expiring, the user will receive a notification that their food is about to go bad, and the app will suggest recipes for the user to use the ingredients(s) that are about to expire.
