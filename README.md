# StayFresh
HackHarvard Project

StayFresh is a project that my team worked on during HackHarvard 2015.  Due to errors with software and compatability, we were unable to connect our backend data to our frontend Swift programming.  However, we are hoping to complete this program soon and we had a lot of fun with it!
